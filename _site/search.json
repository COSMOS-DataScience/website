UC Irvine is one of the campuses\nthat hosts talented high school students enrolled in one of the many clusters.\nThis specific cluster focuses on data science in biomedical\nsciences.\nThis cluster explores how data science is used to better understand\nbiological and medical processes. Think about the data recorded from the\ncell activities of the brain of a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer’s\ndisease. What are the most striking patterns of this data in contrast\nwith the data obtained from a person with normal brain activity? What\nregions in the brain demonstrate such abnormalities more vividly and is\nthere a way to use data from potentially a large number of patients to\nbuild a tool or mechanism for predicting Alzheimer’s in the early stages\nof its development? How reliable can such a tool be, and is there a way\nto improve its reliability as we collect more data from more\nsubjects?\nIn this cluster, students will acquire the data science skills needed\nto answer questions as they apply to numerous disciplines in the\nbiological sciences, including but not limited to neuroscience, public\nhealth, and pharmacology. Students will cover exploratory data analysis,\ndata visualization, foundations of probability, design of experiments,\nlinear models, and foundations of machine learning, and statistical\ninference. Students will learn the R programming language to analyze,\nsummarize, and visualize data (no prior programming experience is\nrequired). Student capstone projects will involve working with real data\nto solve a scientific problem in one of the above disciplines.\n\n\n\n",
